# Python-DogAI
Python script using a Teachable Machine AI I built myself to recognize dogs in life and images. The script then works with an arduino script and external led which lights up when the image of the dog is recognized.
For this project you will need tensorflow, opencv for python, and pillow, also since tensorflow does not yet support python 3.12 you will need python 3.11 or lower.
